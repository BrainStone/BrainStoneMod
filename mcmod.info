The are as fast as iron tools but you can havrest more than 2,500 blocks! (Diamond tools only 1,000). The latest feature is the Brain Logic Block. It is nearly all logic gates and flip flops in one block. And it only needs one redstone tick!\nSo enjoy!\n\n\nAnd thanks for downloading and supporting this mod!",
